A filly with blue starry mane once said:
 "You are mine and mine alone, mine to know and take."
And the nightsky did not answer, because it didn't know how.
But the words were spoken, and with them she ate the stars.



There once was a filly with starry blue mane who said,

 “You are mine and mine alone, mine to know and take.”

And the night sky didn’t answer, because it didn’t know how.

But the words were spoken, and with them she ate the stars.




One by one she engulfed, each as bright as those in her own mane.

She learned their names, their places, the dreams that had birthed them and the nightmares they were protected by.

She ate and she ate until she was sick, and only then did she realize:

That no one saw this beauty, not like she did.



And her choice was that she would be a nightmare, the greatest nightmare of them all to protect her stars from the greatest tragedy, that of being ignored.







My name is Nisa.

To my mother's people, this name is that of a guide and steward. A moon-seeker that guides others through the dark.

To my father's people, this name is a foreign beauty, enticing but meaningless in it’s obfuscated significance.

To me…
